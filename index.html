			<h4>Raw</h4>
				<div class="card">
					<p>Rawstyle is a new subgenus of Dutch Hardstyle. Created around 2011, it takes up the Dutch Hardstyle influenced by Hardcore with darker melodies and adds oldschool and hardcore characteristics, usually with more distortion on the "Kick". It can sometimes be brutal. 
					</p>
					<p>Rawstyle can often be very experimental, often using unconventional techniques and methods to achieve a certain sound. It can be found in the works of artists such as D-Sturb, Rejecta, Radical Redemption, Act of Rage...

			<h4>Extra-Raw</h4>
				<div class="card">
					<p>The Extra-Raw style is a type of Rawstyle which is more of a solo genre. It's much more experimental and more aggressive. It can be found in the works of artists such as Warface, Rooler, Deetox and many others. This type of Rawstyle is normally done with a very deformed kick. It is mainly focused on the punch (the "kick" of a Hardstyle kick) with a much weaker tail than the Hardstyle.

			<h4>Hardcore</h4>
				<div class="card">
					<p>
					Hardcore refers to a variant of the much more aggressive hardcore style originally from European raves, which emerged during the 1990s. These musical genres generally stand out from other electronic music currents by their greater speed (160 to 200 BPM or more), the intensity of the kicks (often the same) and basses (in some derived music), the rhythm and atmosphere, their themes (sometimes violent), the use of saturation and experiments close to those conceived by the industrial music current.</p>
